# uep239FinalProj
Public Repository for uep239 Geospatial Programming with Python final project

## General Structure of this project:

1. Define a topic for a suitability or vulnerability analysis
    + Ex: What are the most suitable ZIP Code Tabulation Areas for certain groups to live in (college students, new families, etc...)
2. Choose at least four indicators to include in your analysis and base an overall index or score on
    + Pop density
    + Age/sex distribution
    + Edu attainment
    + Occupational distr
    + Avg household income
    + Housing Price/Rent cost
    + Accessibility to certain amenities
3. For each indicator, the analysis must:
    + Visualize spatial data that the indicator is based on
    + Summarize indicator values for each ZCTA in the study area
    + Produce a choropleth map visualizing indicators and produce ZCTA ranking based on indicator values from highest to lowest value
    + Convert indicator values into suitability or vulnerability index or score
    + visualize single indicator based score on choropleth map
4. Summarize single indicator based scores or indices into an overall weighted and unweighted score or index. Justify chosen weights or lack of weighting.
5. Visualize overall suitability or vulnerability index or score on a choropleth map and produce ZCTA ranking based on score or index from highest to lowest ranking
